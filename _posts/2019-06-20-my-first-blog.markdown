This is my very first blog .
I am just writing some random words to test if this works.

Now I will write some shitty random code to check if it works :

{% highlight cpp %}
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"this shit works , or not ?";
    cout<<"It works";
}
{% endhighlight %}
