`sed` is a stream editing tool made by GNU. A stream editor is used to perform
text transformations on a input stream ( a file or redirected input from a pipe ).
sed works by taking an edit script and modifies the input stream according to the edit
script.

`sed` comes pre-installed in most of the linux and unix based distributions and can also
be installed easily from the distribution's package manager.

A basic sed invocation can be :
{% highlight bash %}
sed SCRIPT INPUTFILE...
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's look at the following file **INPUT.txt** ..

now if you want to change all the occurences of 'Linux' to 'Windows' , you can simply do this :

{% highlight bash %}
sed 's/Linux/Windows/' INPUT.txt
{% endhighlight %}

the output will be

here 's' stands for substitution followed by the string/pattern to be replaced and the replacement string.

It's easy , isn't it ?

**sed** also takes regular expressions as input , which can come handy in times.

Some common regular expresssion are :


\*    -     matches multiple string of any length.

^a    -     matches all the lines starting with a.
